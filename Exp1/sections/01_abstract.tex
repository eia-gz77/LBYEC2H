The coursework explored the application of linear algebra in Matlab in order to solve systems of linear equations. The equations were derived from mesh analysis of a given circuit and the primary objective was to determine unknown currents. Different Matlab functions was also used to validate the computed mesh currents. Additionally, the properties of the matrix representation was also determined by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix. The results showed that all solution methods yielded identical current values (i1 = 0.0344A, i2 = -0.0160A, i3 = -0.0413A, i4 = -0.0867A), verifying the consistency of the mathematical models.
