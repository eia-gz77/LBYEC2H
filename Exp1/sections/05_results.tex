\subsection{How do the results achieve the objectives?}
By:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Up to two lines per item.
\item Up to two lines per item.
\end{enumerate}
	
\subsection{Why do the results achieve the objectives?}
Because:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Up to two lines per item.
\item Up to two lines per item.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Are all your results correct in accordance with what you described in Sec.~\ref{sec:eval} evaluation process? Why?} 
Yes/no, because:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Up to two lines per item.
\item Up to two lines per item.
\end{enumerate}
	
\subsection{What is result $X$ (briefly describe it here), what does it mean if it is correct, and how does it contribute to reaching the objectives?}
\label{sec:resn}
		
		\begin{enumerate}		
		\item Refer to the appropriate caption number of your result, i.e. Fig.~$X$ for figure $X$, Table~$X$ for table $X$, etc.	
		\item Interpret result $X$ and the reasons why it was obtained.
\item Point out and explain apparent discrepancies from principles/concepts/theory if your result is incorrect.
\begin{enumerate}
			\item Explanation 1
			\item Explanation 2
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item Cite existing publication for comparison of your result.
\item Do not present your result as ``It worked'' without an appropriate explanation as such action does not show thorough understanding.
\item Repeat Sec.~\ref{sec:resn} for each major result $X$ (i.e. $X$=1, $X$=2, etc.).
\end{enumerate}

For example, result $X = 1$ (on the accuracy performance of the enhanced bi-directive method):

\begin{enumerate}
\item Figure \ldots shows that the performance of the system is satisfactory up to 90\%.
\item The result in Figure \ldots was obtained because of the bi-directive mechanism of the proposed architecture.
\item The remaining 10\% accuracy loss is due to the failure of the bi-directive mechanism to \ldots and supported by \ldots.
\item Reference~\cite{Einstein1905} also achieved similar range of results from 85\% to 93\%.
\item \ldots
\end{enumerate}
	
\subsection{Did you cite more than two publications in your answers above (yes/no)?}
Yes.
