\subsection{What are the objectives of the coursework?}

\begin{enumerate}
\item To utilize Matlab's Symbolic Math Toolbox and equation editors to represent and solve systems of linear equations;
\item To solve a 4-mesh circuit problem using Matrix Representation, Cramer’s Rule, Matrix Inversion, and Matlab's solve function;
\item To determine and verify the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system matrix.
\end{enumerate}	
	
\subsection{How does the coursework fit the course and previously done coursework?}
By:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Integrating Mesh Analysis and Kirchoff's Voltage Law with linear algebra matrix methods.
\item Transitioning from manual calculation methods to Matlab functions for solving the linear equations.
\end{enumerate}	

\subsection{How were the objectives achieved?}
By:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Writing mesh equations for a 4-loop resistive circuit and converting them into Matrix form Ai = c.
\item Implementing Matlab scripts to calculate determinants for Cramer's rule and inverses for matrix solution.
\end{enumerate}
	
\subsection{What are the key results and generalizations?}
The key results are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The mesh currents were consistently calculated to be i1 = 0.0344A, i2 = -0.0160A, i3 = -0.0413A, and i4 = -0.0867A across all methods.
\item The eigenvalues of the system matrix were calculated as approximately 184.05, 145.95, 130.60, and 45.40.
\end{enumerate}
